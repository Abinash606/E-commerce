# E-commerce Application

This is a full-stack **E-commerce application** built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Ruby on Rails** for the backend. The application provides a seamless shopping experience with features such as:  

- **Responsive User Interface**: Built with Next.js to ensure fast, interactive, and mobile-friendly design.  
- **Product Management**: Admin can add, update, and manage products through the Rails backend.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for customers.  
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Users can add products to the cart, manage quantities, and complete purchases.  
- **Order Management**: Rails backend handles order processing, tracking, and status updates.  
- **API Integration**: Frontend communicates with backend APIs for dynamic data handling.  

This project demonstrates the integration of a modern React-based frontend with a robust Rails backend for a complete e-commerce solution.
